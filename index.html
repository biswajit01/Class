            <p>In line with ongoing moves by US tech giant Apple to revamp its PC line of iMacs, it has now been announced that the iMac Pro, which is barely four years old, having been launched in 2017, will be rested after its present stock of units is exhausted. This is a clear indication that the iMac Pro was not able to pull the punches required of it and has not had any significant upgrades since its debut, which obviously had affected its overall performance rating.</p>
